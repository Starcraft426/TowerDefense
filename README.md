# TowerDefense

This is my tower defense. Fisrt it was a project for school but now i want to go further.

## How to play

In order to play it just download the git.

If you're using pycharm, download the venv<your_machine_os>.zip and unzip it on the main folder or install the required modules.
Now you can launch the game by starting the main.py

## The commands to install the modules

Here are the commands to install the modules
```
pip install pygame
```
```
pip install pytmx
```
```
pip install pyscroll
```
```
pip install requests
```

## If you have an older version than v1.2-beta

Just get the autoupdate.py file, modify the current_version to 
```
self.current_version = "v1.0"
```
and run the file
